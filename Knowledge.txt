**Notes for Implementation:**

*   **RAG:**  You'll need to create a knowledge base (documents, FAQs, workout descriptions, nutritional information) and a retrieval mechanism (like a vector 
database) that can find relevant information based on Alex's queries.  This is the core of the RAG system.
*   **Chat Interface:**  This dataset is the input for a simple chatbot. The chatbot will use the RAG system to answer user questions related to Alex's 
workouts, nutrition, and progress.
*   **Scalability:**  This is a basic example.  To make this system truly useful, you'll need to add more data points, expand the knowledge base, and implement 
more advanced features (e.g., personalized recommendations, dynamic workout adjustments).
